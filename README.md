Example for Lazy Loading of Responsive Background Images
========================================================

This is inspired by this article:
http://www.markdixon.ca/design/blog/lazy-load-background-images-a-workaround/ which uses the [Inview event plugin](http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/)

I added a fallback CSS in case the user has Javascript disabled.
